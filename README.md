# FacebookVideoDownloader

My first experience with Chrome extensions.
The extension works in client side so it doesn't need no cookies or a server to do the work. It can download any Facebook video Public or Private easily.

You can watch this [DEMO video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=230A1f1fHNc) to see how to use it.

Please Note: This extension was created on 28 April 2020 and it works just for the new Facebook design, old one isn't supported.
